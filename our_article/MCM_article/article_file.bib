abstract = {In this paper, we present a Leslie–Gower type of food chain system composed of three species, which are resource, consumer, and predator, respectively. The digestion time delays corresponding to consumer-eat-resource and predator-eat-consumer are introduced for more realistic consideration. It is called the resource digestion delay (RDD) and consumer digestion delay (CDD) for simplicity. Analyzing the corresponding characteristic equation, the stabilities of the boundary and interior equilibrium points are studied. The food chain system exhibits the species coexistence for the small values of digestion delays. Large RDD/CDD may destabilize the species coexistence and induce the system dynamic into recurrent bloom or system collapse. Further, the present of multiple delays can control species population into the stable coexistence. To investigate the effect of time delays on the recurrent bloom of species population, the Hopf bifurcation and periodic solution are investigated in detail in terms of the central manifold reduction and normal form method. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to display some complex dynamics, which include multiple periodic solution and chaos motion for the different values of system parameters. The system dynamic behavior evolves into the chaos motion by employing the period-doubling bifurcation.}

abstract = {A modified Leslie–Gower-type prey–predator model composed of a logistic prey with Holling’s type II functional response is studied. The axial point (1,0) is found to be globally asymptotically stable in a domain. Condition for stability of the non-trivial equilibrium point is obtained. The existence of stable limit cycle of the system is also established. The analysis for Hopf bifurcation is carried out. The numerical simulations are carried out to study the effects of seasonally varying parameters of the model. The system shows the rich dynamic behavior including bifurcation and chaos.}
