## 2 Assumptions and Notations

### 2.1 Assumptions and Explanations

* 区域假设：假设模型适用的区域是东南亚地区。

  justification：东南亚地区气候变化简单，只有雨季和旱季两个季节；此外，一年之内温度变化幅度很小。

* 种植模式假设：模型假设农田每年种植两茬水稻。

  justification：符合东南亚的种植模式，同时作物种类简单，便于建立模型。

* 稳定的生长环境假设：假设模型适用时间范围内没有大幅度影响农田生态系统的自然灾害。

  justification：自然灾害在农业活动中属于小概率事件，为保证模型的泛用性，不应当考虑自然灾害。

  >- **Regional Assumption**: The model assumes that the applicable region is Southeast Asia.
  >
  >  **Justification**: The climate of Southeast Asia is simple, with only two seasons—rainy and dry. Additionally, the temperature variation within a year is minimal.
  >
  >- **Planting Pattern Assumption**: The model assumes that two crops of rice are planted each year in the farmland.
  >
  >  **Justification**: This aligns with the planting patterns commonly observed in Southeast Asia, and the simplicity of crop types makes the model easier to establish.
  >
  >- **Stable Growth Environment Assumption**: The model assumes that no natural disasters, which could significantly impact the agricultural ecosystem, will occur during the time frame considered.
  >
  >  **Justification**: Natural disasters are considered low-probability events in agricultural activities. To ensure the generalizability of the model, natural disasters should not be considered.
